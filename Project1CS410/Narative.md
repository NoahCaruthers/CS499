# Overview
For this code there are clear and glaring issues because of a lack of security. I would like to implement a database to store user information and passwords to make sure that this code upholds secure coding practices. Since there is data containing sensitive information, I think that this is necessary and logical.
# Review
This artifact is the CS410 project one artifact. Its purpose is to have a user login, view the clients, and make appropriate edits to their business types. The biggest issue with this program was that it did not have data storage at all. I wanted to add a database with a user login table and to make it easier to edit client information.

This artifact was necessary to showcase my ability to integrate a database into an already created program. I think that I have done so in a professional and appropriate manner that will display my ability to work with SQL and applications. The artifact now has a table that stores all usernames and passwords. It also has the ability to register new users.  
-	Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices (data structures and algorithms)
-	Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software engineering/design/database)
-	Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources

These are the course outcomes that I believe that I have met with the integration of the database into this program. This covers everything that I wanted to cover and more. When I was updating this artifact I learned a lot about the visual studio software and how it works with SQLexpress to take advantage of the SQL databases and structures.
